                        <p>Real Madrid is a football club based in Madrid. The club competes in Laliga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity.</p>

                        <p>He was one of the first pioneers of football in Madrid, playing for some of the earliest Madrid clubs in existence, such as Sky Football, of which he was a member from 1897 to 1900. Following a breakaway in 1900, he helped form Madrid Football Club, which is now known as Real Madrid, and was its first president and captain.</p>

                        <p>Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943. Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera," known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.</p>
